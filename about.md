Phebe Polk is a Statistical Programmer living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area. She has created and maintained some GitHub repositories, most recently py511SFBay.

In her spare time, Polka answers questions on Stack Overflow related to R, Python and Data Science.  From time to time, she uses Python to gather data from open data API's and ggplot2 to make pretty charts from that data.

Polka grew up with both the internet and technology since a young age, when she took apart motor's and old broken cell phones and vcr's with her father, an electrical engineer.  She grew up playing educational computer games like "The Oregon Trail" and "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego" and not so educational games like "Doom" and "Myst".  Throughout her teenage years, she was a top student-athlete winning scholarships to elite schools.

Polka, this blog, is a blog of how-to's, open data projects, and product reviews.
