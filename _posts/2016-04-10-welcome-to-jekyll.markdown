So as a professional today, a portfolio website is essential to demonstrating your knowledge to the world.  This is my second attempt at a portfolio website.

How did I make this website?  

First I downloaded [ruby](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).

Next I used the `gem install jekyll` command.

Finally I ran a `jekyll new portfolio` command.

I customized the default website by re-writing the specifics of the relevant files and uploaded it to github pages for free hosting.

Finally, when I uploaded it to github, the formatting was missing from the site.  The solution was to add the foldername to the value for baseurl in the _conf.yaml file.

The plan for version three is to use a custom theme and to make some custom images, but for that I need to bribe some of my friends who can draw ;p.
